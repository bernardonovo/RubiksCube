## A Rubik's Cube implementation in Python

### Objectives

Hello, my name is Bernardo and this a Rubik's Cube implementation using Python
3.x and Panda3D. I made this as the main part of my coursework for my A-level
Computer Science class, over the course of around about 9 months.

The objective of this coursework was to create a working program using the
language of our choice. Mine was to create a working and maneuverable Rubik's
Cube inside Python. However, I never got around to properly finishing it due
to covid. The cube is fully functional, but I never got to writing the code
that solves it, which was meant to be part of the original design.

I'm making this code available in the hopes that it will be useful to other
students like myself, or anyone else to whom it may interest.

### Reference material

- [An implementation of a Rubik's Cube in Python](https://discourse.panda3d.org/t/rubiks-cube-in-panda/15586/4). Most of the Panda3D code I used was borrowed from this source
- [David W.Hogg's Magic Cube](https://github.com/davidwhogg/MagicCube). Contains a Rubik's Cube implementation in MatplotLib, plus a neat solver in Python.
